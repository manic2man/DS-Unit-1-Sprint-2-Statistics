# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
 
 Just to name one one of my hobbies, I do a bit of strength training, and I find the science behind exercise fascinating.

What do you know about?

I have looked quite a bit into how different forms, methodologies (concepts like time under tension), muscle groups, 
 and hormones play into what we might refer to as "gains".

What decisions do you face?

There are a lot of decisions, like how much time to set aside, creating a routine with recovery in mind (without porper
 recovery you can do more harm than good), what to eat based on workout goals, defining the goals (burning fart, building endurance,
 building exploisive strength, putting on muscle), and of course issues like self motivation.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

The only thing that I can think is that maybe different supplement companies have different regional influence,
 but that is just an assumption.

2. Trend related to the news

I dont know  about "news" persay, but celebrities are often a source of fitness advice based on their own
 transformations, which can themselves be looked at as examples of ways to achieve ones fitness goals.
 How much work do they put in (hint: a lot more than the average person can, given other obligations)

3. Who does that?

Different age groups exercise and diet differently. Each sex often has completely different goals when it comes
 to fitness. Local availability of gyms and community centers also likely plays a huge role. There's a lot of
 data to break down there.

4. Answering a question people care about

I work in a grocery store, and every week there's new issues of magazines promising to help people lose
 weight or get thier dream body with just a simple trick. Deep down I think everyone knows that these
 don't work. But I wonder by what measure these kinds of messages help sell these magazines.

5. Valuable to businesses

Supplements, workout equipment, diet plans, workout trackers (like fitbit), ect... there are numerous
 businesses tied to helping people live happier healthier lives.

6. What's the most popular?

Keto diet is certainly popular right now, knowing and ranking the popularity of different fad diets is
 maybe a little outside my stated interest, but it is related.

7. Cost/Money rankings

Gyms and workout equipment is certainly interesting, but I suspect supplement is where the real money is at.
 Though which supplements and which company is doing the best might interest me.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

There's a lot of misconceptions, for instance yoyo dieting (taking on highly restrictive diets that you stop
 once you've reach your goal) though popular is actually really bad for you, it is particularly hard on your heart.
 Also, on the topic of strength training, because hormones play such a huge role in muscle growth, there are some
 counter-intuitive things there, like you might assume that working out more gets better results, but it doesnt,
 it can actually set you back if you're not careful.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

Interesting enough, storytelling interests me. Specifically how different kinds of stories fit into
 different kinds of media and how that affects consumption.

What do you know about?

As something of a storyteller, different achetypes, genres, and storytelling techniques are all things
 I consider when looking at the larger backdrop of entertainment in general.

What decisions do you face?

Finding new and intersting stories is often on my mind. How, now that's the question. Is it a matter of unknown
 unknowns. How do you search for something that you don't know exists. Algorithms only help so much.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Different genres and formulas are often hidden behind cultural barriers. We mostly consume media made in North
 America or that was written long ago. But translations of stories from other languages are getting easier to make and that trickle
 may turn into a flood given time.

2. Trend related to the news

There are a number of distinctions and recommendations (New York Times Bestseller for instance) that may attract more
 people to purchasing it, it would be interesting to know how much of an impact these actually have.

3. Who does that?

Different demographics consume different kinds of media. Most people enjoy movies and television, but there others
 like comics, novels, short stories, with likely a lot of variation in genre and consumption rates based on sex, age and ethnicity.

4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses

Finding the right kind of media based on each persons own personal tastes is a large part of many business models
 currently. From Youtube and Netflix as heavyweights of the industry, to smaller companies that host comics online.

6. What's the most popular?

Popularity rankings are another useful tool, particularly for those new to a platform or simply looking for ideas, to find
 something new to try.

7. Cost/Money rankings

There are a lot of companies out there hosting media (funimation is one tried not too long ago). Comparing the
 cost of these services against the size of their libraries and how much the average use actually uses these services
 could be pretty informative.
